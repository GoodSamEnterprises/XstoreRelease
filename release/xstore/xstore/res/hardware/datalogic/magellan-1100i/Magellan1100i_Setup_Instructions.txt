DataLogic Magellan 1100i Setup Instructions

1) Run the included DataLogic-USB-Serial-R96-9636.msi file to install the USB-Serial Driver
2) Scan the programming barcodes in the programDL1100i.rtf document in numerical order. (Note: After scanning the first barcode, the device may not respond for a moment)
3) Confirm that a com port was installed for the scanner.
4) Configure Xstore to use the DataLogic-Scanner-RS232 jpos device (Note: The portName property may need to be adjusted to match the com port where the scanner was installed)

Installer Note:
1) If the scanner does not appear to be responding, it may already be in Serial mode (which requires the device to be claimed for it to work).  If this is the case, you should be able to install the serial driver and configure the device in Xstore.  Once the device has been claimed by Xstore, you can proceed with scanning the programming barcodes.
