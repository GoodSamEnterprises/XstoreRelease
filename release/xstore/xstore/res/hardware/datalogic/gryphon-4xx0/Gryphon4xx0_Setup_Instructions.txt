DataLogic Gryphon 4xx0 Setup Instructions

1) Run the included DataLogic-USB-Serial-R96-9636.msi file to install the USB-Serial Driver
2) Scan the programming barcodes in the GBT4400.pdf document in the order that they appear. (Note: After scanning the first barcode, the device may not respond for a moment as it resets.  If the scanner is in a mode that prevents it from scanning, holding the trigger for 5-10 seconds will allow it to switch to a forced imput mode that will allow scanning.)
3) Confirm that a com port was installed for the scanner.
4) Configure Xstore to use the DataLogic-Scanner-RS232 jpos device (Note: The portName property may need to be adjusted to match the com port where the scanner was installed)
